# TicTacToeJava
# Overview

To demonstrate and enhance my abilities to use Java I created a Tic-Tac-Toe game that uses functions and loops to create an exciting and continous game.
The software is also capable of reading and writing to a file for saved games. The purpose of the Tic-Tac-Toe game is to create a nostalgic atmosphere with 
new technology that can adapt to a busy lifestyle.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
